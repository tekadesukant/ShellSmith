### **What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. It tracks changes in source code, enabling collaboration and maintaining a history of changes.

### **Why Use This Script?**

Setting up Git manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This script automates the installation and initial configuration process, ensuring that Git is properly set up and ready to use with minimal effort.

### **Script Details**

The `InstallGit.bat` script performs the following actions:

- **Downloads Git**: Retrieves the latest version of Git from the official source.
- **Installs Git**: Executes the installation process with default settings.
- **Configures Git**: Applies basic configuration settings to ensure Git operates smoothly.

### **Troubleshooting**

- **Script Execution Issues**: Ensure that PowerShell is running with administrative privileges.
- **Installation Problems**: Verify that your system meets the requirements for installing Git and that there are no connectivity issues during the download.
